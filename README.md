**A dynamic and adaptive alternative to MyFitnessPal — built for people who are constantly changing.**

Elephit Fitness is designed to evolve with *you.* It’s a smarter way to track calories, macros, and progress that understands your body’s fluctuations day by day.  
When you’re on track, the app rewards you; when your body shifts, Elephit adjusts your daily calorie targets automatically — because the tools you use to improve your health should *make it easier*, not harder.
